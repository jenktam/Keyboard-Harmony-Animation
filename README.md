# Keyboard Harmony Animation

This app is designed to play a new sound any time a new key is pressed. I built this using Paper.js for the graphics and howler.js for the audio sounds. I learned the power of Javascript frameworks and libraries while having a blast building this visual animation.

To view the working demo, please click [here](https://jenktam.github.io/Keyboard-Harmony-Animation/).

I created a new animation as an extension of the previous version with different shapes that rotate and appear on the screen when a key is pressed. 

That demo can be viewed [here](https://jenktam.github.io/Keyboard-Harmony-Animation/triangles.html).
